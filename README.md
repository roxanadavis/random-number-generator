# random-number-generator
The tool is a Random Number Generator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user clicks on the "Generate Number" button, the JavaScript function generateRandomNumber() is triggered, which generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the Math.random() function. The generated number is displayed on the web page using the innerHTML property of the <p> element with the id="result".

The HTML code includes a header with the title "Random Number Generator", a brief description of the tool, and the button to trigger the JavaScript function. The CSS code is used to style the page elements, including the font, button color, and footer.

The footer includes a copyright notice and can be used to include a link to the website that hosts the tool. This tool can be used for a variety of applications, such as generating a random number for a lottery, a game, or for selecting a winner in a contest.
